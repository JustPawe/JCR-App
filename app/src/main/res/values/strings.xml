    <string name="history">Hulme Hall prides itself not only on its expansive and rich history, but on its traditions which still are a vital part of hall life today. The history of Hulme Hall dates back to 1691 when Manchester landowner William Hulme left his property to trustees and their heirs. In 1869, William Houldsworth, trustee of Owen’s College which formed the foundations of the University, formed a Church of England hall for the college’s students. As the University evolved into what we see today, so did Hulme Hall. The hall was first opened on a site in Plymouth Grove in January 1887 and then moved to the current site of Houldsworth in July 1907, housing just 40 students. By 1967, Birley, Greenwood, Christie, Plymouth and Oaklands were constructed, with Burkhardt House finished in 1994. The hall officially began to admit female students in the 1980s, completing the hall we know today.</string>
